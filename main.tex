Educational Data mining is an emerging research area in Data Mining. This area associates to discovering relevant and useful knowledge from academic records using various data mining techniques. Every educational institute wants to provide maximum facility to the students and faculties and expects maximum output from the students and faculties. It is very important to regularly monitor the students' performances for better accountability. More importantly, the format of the data records can be modified or changed to apply knowledge discovery techniques and gather some statistical output to analyze the performance of the students and faculties as well as the departments.
\newline

In this thesis work, we present a knowledge discovery process in BUET Institutional Information System student data using classification rules. We derived a technique to find the overall performance of a student and a department. Before applying classification, we preprocessed the given data set to remove unnecessary and irrelevant data and columns. After combining relevant columns and removing impurities from data, we designed our training data with our five different class labels. We apply the ID3 classification algorithm on our designed test data according to the decision tree made from our training data. We analyze the final output to gather some statistical results for better visualization of the findings. These results hope to be helpful to analyze the performance of individual students and departments and decision making for top management.
